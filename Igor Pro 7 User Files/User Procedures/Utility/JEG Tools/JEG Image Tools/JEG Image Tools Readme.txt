Specifically, if the wave is of integral type, then	the data dimension max and min are taken to correspond to the full	range of the appropriate integer size, e.g., an 8 bit unsigned integer	wave with data dimension full scale of 0Ñ16 nm would scale each data 	unit to 0.0625 nm and a value of 256 would correspond to 16 nm.		As of version 3.0, allows offsetting upper or lower threshold to zero.	Preferences panel allows user customization of layout.	No longer assumes the image is displayed left vs. bottom.	Supports traces which are displayed with a color as f(z) of another wave.	Renamed from "JEG Z-Legend"	Properly determines bounds of complex waves History modified by	 rev reason -------- --- --- ----------- 09/26/96 JEG 1.0 original 12/15/96 JEG 2.0 Color index waves & integral wave scaling 3/2/97   JEG 3.0 Zero offset, preferences panel, & f(z) traces  Needs:   "JEG Extract Dimensions" version >= 1.1   "JEG Keyword-Value"   <strings as lists>################################################################### FILE: "JEG Scale-Bar"                                   created: 3/3/97 {12:32:15 PM}                                last update: 3/13/97 {2:18:54 PM}           Appends a scale bar to an image in the current graph (works for traces, too).

Opting not to do either saves a  tremendous amount of memory, but you're obviously climbing without a rope.  Drag a marquee in the "Spectral Filter" window and then select "JEG_PassFilter" or "JEG_StopFilter" from the marquee menu. The Spectral Filter's magnitude and the working image will be automatically updated to reflect the change. Select "JEG_UndoLastFilter" from the marquee menu (drag a new marquee, if necessary) to return to the last step (assuming you opted to keep an "undo" matrix).  "JEG Zoom Image" may prove useful in conjunction with this package          modified by  rev reason -------- --- --- ----------- 3/7/97   JEG 1.0 original  Needs:   "JEG Keyword-Value"   "JEG Color Legend" version >= 3.0   <Autosize Images>   <Strings as Lists>   ################################################################### FILE: "JEG Zoom Graph"                                   created: 3/8/97 {3:23:17 AM}                                last update: 3/13/97 {2:19:58 PM}           When multiple image frames are present (multiple pairs of axes), the Expand and Shrink marquee routines don't work properly; they scale all waves that fall between any bounds, not just the ones that fall within the marquee. These routines correct this discrepancy. modified by  rev reason -------- --- --- ----------- 3/8/97   JEG 1.0 original ###################################################################
